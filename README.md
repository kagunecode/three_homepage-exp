# three_homepage_exp

Welcome to this repo. It's purely experimental so expect things to be broken. I'll try to keep it updated on what's working and what's not.

As of now the 3D version contains a lot of unused content, but most of it is functional when rendered inside the Canvas r3f element.
The non 3d version of App is terribly broken as I'm focusing on 3D development as of now.
